# R function for computing two-way cluster-robust standard errors.
# The code below was adapted by Ian Gow on May 16, 2011 using code supplied
# via Mitchell Petersen's website by Mahmood Arai, Jan 21, 2008. 
#
# Apart from a little cleanup of the code, the main difference between this
# and the earlier code is in the handling of missing values. Look at the file
# cluster.test.R to see example usage. Note that care should be taken to 
# do subsetting outside of the call to lm or glm, as it is difficult to recon-
# struct subsetting of this kind from the fitted model. However, the code
# does handle transformations of variables in the model (e.g., logs). Please
# report any bugs, suggestions, or errors to iandgow@gmail.com. The output has 
# been tested fairly extensively against output of Mitchell Petersen's 
# cluster2.ado commmand (hence implicitly against the Matlab and SAS code posted 
# elsewhere here), but I have not tested the code against code for non-linear 
# models, such as logit2.ado.

# See: Thompson (2006), Cameron, Gelbach and Miller (2006) and Petersen (2010).
# and Gow, Ormazabal, and Taylor (2010) for more discussion of this code
# and two-way cluster-robust standard errors.

# The arguments of the function are data, fitted model, cluster1 and cluster2
# You need to install packages `sandwich' by Thomas Lumley and Achim Zeileis and
# `lmtest' by Torsten Hothorn, Achim Zeileis, Giovanni Millo and David Mitchell.
# (For example, type install.packages("sandwich") on the R console.)
